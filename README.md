Step 1: Application Setup

- Andruino: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
- Processing: https://processing.org/download/
- Download Processing library for the OpenCV computer vision library: https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing
- Copy video libary to processing library folder

Step 2: Change the pin accordingly for servo

Step 3: Modify Serial Port to connect facedection (pde) and andruino (ino)

Step 4: Run pde and ino
